# Homework 01 -Socket-Programming (_IE5022 [2021/JAN]_)
This repository contains code for first home work which was been given 30th Jan 2021 under the ANS lecture.

This home works was been done using two languages,
  - Python
  - NodeJs _(More familiar with JS related frameworks)_

> Before executing following commands, `Python3` and `NodeJs` need to installed in the system.
